== Facebook Auth Example App.

See http://richonrails.com/articles/facebook-authentication-in-ruby-on-rails for details.

NOTE:  Be sure to add your facebook app id and secret to the omniauth initializer prior to running this example app.
May need to run bundle update if you're getting bundle errors in the terminal
